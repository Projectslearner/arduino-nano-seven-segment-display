# Seven Segment Display

#### Project Overview

The Seven Segment Display project demonstrates how to interface a common cathode seven-segment display with an Arduino Nano to display numbers from 0 to 9. Seven-segment displays are commonly used for numerical representation in digital devices such as digital clocks, timers, and counters.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Common Cathode Seven Segment Display**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Seven Segment Display to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect segment A to pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect segment B to pin 3 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect segment C to pin 4 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect segment D to pin 5 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect segment E to pin 6 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect segment F to pin 7 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect segment G to pin 8 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the common cathode pin of the display to GND.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the seven segment display to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the seven segment display.
   - The display will cycle through numbers from 0 to 9 repeatedly.

#### Applications

- **Digital Counters:** Use seven segment displays to show counts in various applications such as timers and counters.
- **Digital Clocks:** Implement seven segment displays to display time in hours and minutes.
- **Measurement Devices:** Utilize seven segment displays to show measurements such as temperature and humidity.

#### Notes

- Ensure the correct pin mapping between the Arduino Nano and the seven segment display.
- Adjust the delay value in the code to control the speed at which the numbers are displayed.
- Experiment with additional segments to display characters or symbols beyond numeric digits.
